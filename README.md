Extending CDT Examples and Tutorial
-----------------------------------

Examples of extending Eclipse CDT.

This repository was originally created for training DSF-GDB. There is a [power point presentation](/DSF Tutorial.pptx) that accompanies this repository designed to be presented as a hands-on workshop over two days.

See [first steps for extending DSF](/com.kichwacoders.cdt.dsf.tutorial) or for more advanced work see the [DSF-GDB example project](/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb).

This branch is targetting Eclipse Luna SR2 with CDT 8.6.
