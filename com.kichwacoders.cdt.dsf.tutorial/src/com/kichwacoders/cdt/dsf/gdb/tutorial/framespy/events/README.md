DSF-GDB Integration Part 2
--------------------------

This exercise extends interacting and extracting data from DSF-GDB by
listening to events from DSF-GDB rather than polling

To run the exercise:

 1. Complete TODOs in FrameSpyPollingView.java
 2. Start an Eclipse Appliction
 3. Open the _DSF-GDB Frame Spy with Events_ (_Window_ menu -> _Show View_ -> _Other..._ -> _DSF Tutorial_ -> _DSF-GDB Frame Spy with Events_)
 4. Toggle the Spy on and off with the _Toggle Spy_ button in the view toolbar or context menu.
 5. Optionally run the solution from the _DSF-GDB Frame Spy with Events - Solution_ view
 
The solutions are in the .solution sub-package.
