Timers Example and Exercise
---------------------------

The Timers example is presented as a View in Eclipse. To use:

 1. Start an Eclipse Appliction
 2. Open the _Timers View_ (_Window_ menu -> _Show View_ -> _Other..._ -> _DSF Tutorial_ -> _Timers View_)
 3. Use the commands in the view to interact with the view and data model
 
The Timers exercise extends the Timers example by adding an additional view
that "spies" on the Timers data model called the _Timers Spy_. To run the exercise:

 1. Complete TODOs in SpyTimersView.java
 2. Start an Eclipse Appliction
 3. Open the _Timers View_ (_Window_ menu -> _Show View_ -> _Other..._ -> _DSF Tutorial_ -> _Timers View_)
 4. Open the _Timers Spy_ view (_Window_ menu -> _Show View_ -> _Other..._ -> _DSF Tutorial_ -> _Timers Spy_)
 5. Toggle the Spy on and off with the _Toggle Spy_ button in the view toolbar or context menu.
 6. Optionally run the solution from the _Timers Spy - Solution_ command
 
The solutions are in the .solution sub-package.
