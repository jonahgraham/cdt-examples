This package has the solutions for the View Model exercises.

This package is excluded from the build path. To enable them
and add them to the build path, do this:
- Right-click on "solution"
- Select Build Path -> Include
The reason for excluding from the build path is so that you
don't accidentally get code intermixed from the two packages.
This allows easier copying and pasting of code from solution
to the exercise.
